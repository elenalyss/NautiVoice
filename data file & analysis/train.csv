"Ro-Ro Ferry partially lost propulsion and made contact with quayside, causing the hull to be holed approximately 1 meter above the waterline.  The vessel was approaching its destination, intending to berth. Due to the weather conditions in the port, the vessel requested a tug standby. As the vessel made its final approach, the bow thruster alarm sounded and the engine control room informed the bridge that the number 3 bow thruster had tripped. The tug that was standing by was requested to push at 40% power and then requested to push at 100% power 30 seconds later. At the same time this request was made, number 2 bow thruster tripped. The pitch of the bow thrusters was set to zero and the crew attempted to restart the tripped thrusters. The ECR informed the bridge that they would need to wait 30 seconds before the bow thrusters could be restarted. By the time the bow thrusters had been restarted, there was little that could be done to negate an impact and the 'brace' alarm was sounded across the vessel to warn the crew and passengers. Whilst trying to lift the vessel, the number 3 bow thruster tripped again and the tug was requested to continue pushing at 100% power. The tug only had 1 engine as it had fouled a propeller. The Ro-Ro landed again and whilst alongside, the decision was taken to restart all thrusters and call in another tug to assist which, made fast to the port quarter. With the assistance of the tugs and the vessel's own power, it then made its way to its intended berth. ",Contact,Medium

The ME was stopped and carried out an emergency anchoring procedure under the pilot's guidance. The vessel then berthed alongside with the assistance of two tugs. The cause of the crack was determined to be metal fatigue due to vibrations. ,Damage / Loss Of Equipment,Critical

There were no injuries or pollution, but the fairlead was completely removed from the deck and part of the deck plate was bent upwards and sheared causing a hole. The area below and aft of the fairlead was found to be corroded on and around the weld on the aft part of the pedestal where it was closest to the fishplate.

On entering the river the bow grounded on the edge of the shoal. Due to the vessel's length, the stern of the vessel did not clear the southern side of the dock entrance. This resulted in the vessel’s stern coming to rest on the tyre fendering on the south side of the dock entrance. Using the bow thruster, main engine, and port helm, an attempt was made to clear the shoal and lift the stern off the fendering. Though the stern lifted slightly the bow failed to move.

The pilot ladder should be secured to a strong point, independent of the pilot ladder winch reel and at deck level. - Mechanical securing of the pilot ladder winch reel - All pilot ladder winch reels should have means of preventing the winch reel from being accidentally operated as a result of mechanical failure or human error. A mechanical device or locking pin should be utilized to lock winch reels in position once the pilot ladder is lowered into position. - please check that the lifebuoy(s) in the vicinity of the transfer arrangement have a self activating light attached.

"A cruise ship suffered a black out due to a sensor fault that confused the power management system (PMS). The vessel's crew were carrying out a manual load control test on one of the 4 diesel generators (DG) on board. The generator then had a high temperature alarm on the main baring (later found to be a sensor fault). The next DG in line attempted to start however it could not because the breaker failed to close. This meant that there was only one generator left running which then tripped due to the inbuilt system to prevent reverse power and over speed. Due to the fact that one of the generators was in manual control, this reportedly 'confused' the PMS meaning it could not complete the power restoration sequence as it would do during routine running.  The vessel was blacked out for approximately half an hour before normal running was resumed. There were no injuries, damage or pollution. ",Loss Of Control,Critical

The cause behind the incident was attributed to a combination of the vessels motion in adverse sea conditions, causing the ship to roll moderately, and the passenger's poor positional awareness as well as their age. The vessel had the stabilizers out at the time to minimise the vessel's movement. The master of the vessel had also previously made an announcement after departing the previous port to warn the passengers to take extra care whilst moving around the vessel due to the expected inclement weather. There were no other contributing factors found during an onboard investigation by the crew safety team. The vessel was sheltering in the harbour area of a port at the time of the incident due to heavy weather. ",Accident to person(s),Low
"A general cargo vessel broke multiple mooring lines whilst berthed at a NAABSA (Not always afloat but safely aground) berth. The tide fell during the night and at low water the crew discovered that the vessel had broken away from the berth and was about 10-15m away and had broken all but one mooring line. On the same day, the incident happened again. The break away from the berth was unexpected however vessels regularly sit on the bottom at this particular berth and the issue was thought to be exacerbated by sediment build up caused by heavy rain. Extra mooring ropes with a higher breaking strain will be used in the future and the  terminal is carrying out a survey of the berth. There were no other damages aside from the mooring lines and no injuries or pollution. ",Grounding / Stranding,Low

A cruise ship experienced an explosion on an air-conditioning unit ultimately leading to the failure of propulsion systems for approximately 20 minutes. The explosion of the air-conditioning unit triggered a fire alarm which activated the water mist system for the adjacent diesel generator.

The effect of the explosion on the air-conditioning unit resulted in a frequency disruption and voltage drop on the main switchboard. This lead to the variable frequency drives for the azipod cooling fans being disrupted and causing the azipods to trip. The propulsion was restored after 20 minutes.
