"An LPG tanker parted an aft breast-line when unmooring. The tug on aft stations was asked to change position to the accommodation block as the aft spring lines and aft breast-lines were tangled on the deck and required being slackened before being let go. As the tug moved to the accommodation, the stern of the LPG tanker came away from the berth at speed as the lines slackened, causing the aft breast-line to part. There were no injuries or damages besides the parted line.  Notes:  The main deck of the vessel was located below the jetty level, whereby the mooring lines were heading diagonally upwards instead of directing straight to the pier. One mooring line was directly dropped into the water by the lines man after lifting off the aft spring from the bollard. After the tug received the order from the pilot to shift back on the vessels stern, the Captain of the tug was following the order immediately and rapidly shifted back to the initial position, in order to be available again as fast as possible. While doing this, the Master of the tug did not consider the size ratio between the tug and the ship. The used tug was 32 m long, with a bollard pull of approx. 67 tones. While the tanker was only 87,5 m long. The used tug was oversized compared to the size of the ship. And a small tug movement produced a negative effect onto the ship. The fast position change, correlated with the back flush of the propeller of the tug and the unfavorable breast line heading, led to the breaking of the mooring line.",Damage / Loss Of Equipment,Critical
"A ro-pax vessel departed port, as the vessel cleared the breakwater, an alarm sounded for the forward aquamaster. The vessel continued on to it's destination on the aft propulsion. Port authorities at the destination port were informed and tug assistance requested.

"Passenger ship suffered a machinery failure and went to anchor. One propeller was fouled by a piece of rope causing an engine to shut down. The Master tried to restart the engine but it was not possible. The vessel started to proceed back to the berth with the second engine, but this subsequently shut down as the second propeller was also fouled. The master instructed the mate to drop the anchor and prepare the passengers with lifejackets. The Vessel then waited at anchor until another vessel was available to tow it and secure it safely alongside. At low tide the vessel was able to beach and the propellers were cleared of the the rope that had fouled them. The engines were tested again at high water with no further issues and the vessel was able to return to normal service. ",Contact,Critical

As the line was cast off and being recovered the crew member was using a small diameter guide rope to ensure that the line was layered evenly onto the main storage drum. An investigation is in progress as to the exact cause of injury, suspected to be as a result of unexpected tension on guide rope used to control mooring line placement onto winch drum.  The unmooring operation was suspended when the alarm was raised, and the crew member was disembarked for local medical attention.

"A cement carrier was departing from port on river passage with a pilot on board when there was a momentary propulsion failure. The bridge team observed that the revolutions suddenly dropped and the controls for the main engine switched to 'engine control'. Approximately two seconds later, the main engine control was ready for 'service on bridge' and the master took back control of the main engine immediately and increased to full ahead. The propulsion failure effected the vessel for no longer than 5 seconds. The reason behind the failure was that the chief engineer decided to take control of the main engine down to the engine room without informing the bridge. This was because of the cooling water and lube oil temperatures increasing towards alarm level and the chief engineer intended to set a lock on the main engine RPM to prevent overheating and main engine shut down. The Chief engineer was new on board, it was their first day after joining and the incident was attributed to their lack of familiarity with the system and spontaneous reaction to try to prevent ME overheating. The chief engineer was instructed not to take control from the bridge without informing the bridge team and a set of new thermostats were ordered for the main engine to ensure that the temperature readings were accurate.

Whilst letting go lines, the current caught the vessel and caused it to swing snatching the boarding area towards the quay. This meant that the bulwarks and safety rails making up the specialized boarding gate came into contact with the quay resulting in the gate detaching and falling into the water. This gate is part of the vessel's equipment for carrying out crew transfers safely therefore whilst it is broken the vessel is out of service. The vessel required repairs that needed approval by classification society. The incident was reported to be due to the master misjudging the strength and effect of the current and the mooring arrangement chosen only had a short spring line to prevent the vessel from moving along the quay.
