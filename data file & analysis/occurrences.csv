As discussed please ensure the following additional measures are taken in future when rigging the pilot transfer arrangement to make the process even safer. - Securing of the pilot ladder - the pilot ladder winch real should not be relied upon to support the pilot ladder when the pilot ladder is in use. The pilot ladder should be secured to a strong point, independent of the pilot ladder winch reel and at deck level. - Mechanical securing of the pilot ladder winch reel - All pilot ladder winch reels should have means of preventing the winch reel from being accidentally operated as a result of mechanical failure or human error. A mechanical device or locking pin should be utilized to lock winch reels in position once the pilot ladder is lowered into position. - please check that the lifebuoy(s) in the vicinity of the transfer arrangement have a self activating light attached.

Upon releasing the strap, the first crew member was assigned to hold the plates in position to prevent them from falling, while the second and third crew members moved each plate, one at a time, to a new location approximately 3 metres away. As second crew member with  the third then moved the second plate, the weight became too much for first crew member, who could no longer hold the remaining plates upright. As a result, five plates toppled over, trapping the first crew member between the plates and a vent. A total of five steel plates fell onto first crew member landing onto their lower back, and their stomach was pushed into the vent. It took three crew members to lift the plates and free their colleague. After being freed, they fell to the floor and were assisted out of the way. The three individuals who lifted the five plates off first the person , counted to three before letting the plates fall onto the ground. Unfortunately, one crew member did not move their foot out of the way in time, and one of the plates landed on the top of their steel-toe cap boot, injuring their foot.

The vessel was approaching its destination, intending to berth. Due to the weather conditions in the port, the vessel requested a tug standby. As the vessel made its final approach, the bow thruster alarm sounded and the engine control room informed the bridge that the number 3 bow thruster had tripped. The tug that was standing by was requested to push at 40% power and then requested to push at 100% power 30 seconds later. At the same time this request was made, number 2 bow thruster tripped. The pitch of the bow thrusters was set to zero and the crew attempted to restart the tripped thrusters. The ECR informed the bridge that they would need to wait 30 seconds before the bow thrusters could be restarted. By the time the bow thrusters had been restarted, there was little that could be done to negate an impact and the 'brace' alarm was sounded across the vessel to warn the crew and passengers. Whilst trying to lift the vessel, the number 3 bow thruster tripped again and the tug was requested to continue pushing at 100% power. The tug only had 1 engine as it had fouled a propeller. The Ro-Ro landed again and whilst alongside, the decision was taken to restart all thrusters and call in another tug to assist which, made fast to the port quarter. With the assistance of the tugs and the vessel's own power, it then made its way to its intended berth.

During the process of operating the plunger, the piston rod and handle of the plunger became detached from the piston resulting in the piston remaining at the bottom or the plunger. The IP tried to clear the piston from the plunger using a screwdriver. The IP held the plunger in their non-dominant left hand and tried to insert the screwdriver into the casing of the plunger trough the bottom opening. As the IP applied force to the screwdriver, the screwdriver slipped off the plunger and stabbed the IP’s left hand which resulted in a puncture injury to the soft tissue area of the hand.

She returned to the dock and lined up for the outer passage. On entering the river the bow grounded on the edge of the shoal. Due to the vessel's length, the stern of the vessel did not clear the southern side of the dock entrance. This resulted in the vessel’s stern coming to rest on the tyre fendering on the south side of the dock entrance. Using the bow thruster, main engine, and port helm, an attempt was made to clear the shoal and lift the stern off the fendering. Though the stern lifted slightly the bow failed to move. It was evident that the vessel was wedged athwart the river. On the grounds of safety, the Master informed that they had requested the immediate assistance of a tug to aid their situation. On the prompt arrival of the tug, they directed her to push on the starboard shoulder to clear the shoal and then instructed her to push on the port quarter to safely aid the swing of the vessel. They finally asked her to push on the port bow to help maintain the vessel's position in the deeper water well away from the shoal. When heading out the vessel proceeded safely on outbound passage.

The crewmember was assisting in tying the sail ties around the main sail, that had been lowered, when the boat rocked and the crewmember lost their grip on the rigging and fell backwards onto the deck. They banged their head against the side of the boat and breifly lost consciousness. The on board doctor provided first aid and emergency services attended the vessel once it came alongside, taking the crew member to hospital. The crew member did not have head or spinal injuries but was kept in for observations. They sustained a fracture to their breastbone, bruising to the muscles and the cartilage around their pelvis and received some physiotherapy. The volunteer was experienced on the vessel and with the procedure but was carrying out the procedure in a different location on board than they had done previously, and wasn't aware of the risk of movement that occurs in that location.

The incident reportedly occurred due to the strong winds that were having a significant effect on the offshore vessel. Whilst the vessel was attempting a swing in a turning basin, the stern  made contact with a jetty, causing damage to piles and diagonal braces. The pilot had ordered the vessel to thrust to starboard in order to prevent this contact, and the wash from the thrusters capsized an unoccupied pleasure vessel moored on the same jetty. This vessel remained capsized as the tide fell, causing damage to the cabin and the gunwale. The pleasure vessel was recovered and re-floated and pollution was prevented by the harbour employees. The offshore vessel was able to berth after the incident. The jetty required a structural survey to determine if it was still safe for use after the incident. It was also reported that a loss of situational awareness and lack of reporting also contributed to the incident, as well as visibility constraints from the conning position on board the offshore vessel.

The vessel was alongside a NABSA (Not afloat but safely aground) berth at the time, and as the vessel re-floated, the crew were filling in a ballast tank. The ballast tank overflowed through an on deck vent, and the crew observed that there was an oily sheen around the vessel after this water went overboard. The crew stopped the ballasting and sounded all the tanks. The HFO tank adjacent to the ballast tank being filled showed that it had 3 cubic meters more in it than the previous time it was sounded. As the tide went out the vessel rested on the bottom again and the tanks were sounded again. There was no change in the soundings. The vessel crew determined that there was no exterior hull breach but that there was a suspected bulkhead breach between the ballast tank and the fuel oil tank. The amount of pollution was such that it dissipated with the ebb tide and there was no need for a pollution clean up.

The crewmember noticed flames coming from the turbocharger of the generator that was running. The crewmember activated the emergency stop and left the space, subsequently activating the manual call point for a fire. The crew on the bridge believed that the alarm and sound of the generator shutting down was a blackout but was informed by the crewmember from the engine room shortly after that it was a fire. The emergency procedures for a fire were implemented and the fire was later reported extinguished with no damage reported. The high temperature alarm for the generator had been changed meaning that the alarm didn't activate when it should have done. Reportedly, if the high temperature limit had not been increased, the high temperature alarm would have activated 16 minutes earlier and there would not have been a fire. The fire was believed to have been caused by the gasket for the oil feed pipe being in poor condition allowing oil vapor to contact the hot turbo charger. Additionally, the bolts holding the turbo charger were so loose that they were not even hand-tight. There were no injuries, damage or pollution arising from the incident.

The bridge team observed that the revolutions suddenly dropped and the controls for the main engine switched to 'engine control'. Approximately two seconds later, the main engine control was ready for 'service on bridge' and the master took back control of the main engine immediately and increased to full ahead. The propulsion failure effected the vessel for no longer than 5 seconds. The reason behind the failure was that the chief engineer decided to take control of the main engine down to the engine room without informing the bridge. This was because of the cooling water and lube oil temperatures increasing towards alarm level and the chief engineer intended to set a lock on the main engine RPM to prevent overheating and main engine shut down. The Chief engineer was new on board, it was their first day after joining and the incident was attributed to their lack of familiarity with the system and spontaneous reaction to try to prevent ME overheating. The chief engineer was instructed not to take control from the bridge without informing the bridge team and a set of new thermostats were ordered for the main engine to ensure that the temperature readings were accurate. There were no injuries pollution or damage as a result of the incident and the vessel proceeded on passage without further issue.

The flow of fuel was not noticed until the fuel oil now floating on the surface was witness by an adjacent vessel who alerted the crew aboard. The master investigated and immediately raised the alarm to shut down all systems and begin a SOPEP response. The relevant parties where informed and a spill containment implemented shortly after. The port authority attended to the vessel and begun to deploy a series of oil control booms. The booms were used to stop the spread of the fuel and contain the spill to between the aft of the vessel and the quay wall. The port officer assessed the spill and raised its priority to a tier two response. An oil extraction vehicle was arranged, and additional small craft attended to the scene to assist in manoeuvring the booms and further containing the spill. Once the extraction vehicle had arrived to scene, the operator deployed the extraction hose, with the assistance of the small craft begun to remove the corralled fuel from the boomed area.

The tug on aft stations was asked to change position to the accommodation block as the aft spring lines and aft breast-lines were tangled on the deck and required being slackened before being let go. As the tug moved to the accommodation, the stern of the LPG tanker came away from the berth at speed as the lines slackened, causing the aft breast-line to part. There were no injuries or damages besides the parted line.  Notes:  The main deck of the vessel was located below the jetty level, whereby the mooring lines were heading diagonally upwards instead of directing straight to the pier. One mooring line was directly dropped into the water by the lines man after lifting off the aft spring from the bollard. After the tug received the order from the pilot to shift back on the vessels stern, the Captain of the tug was following the order immediately and rapidly shifted back to the initial position, in order to be available again as fast as possible. While doing this, the Master of the tug did not consider the size ratio between the tug and the ship. The used tug was 32 m long, with a bollard pull of approx. 67 tones. While the tanker was only 87,5 m long. The used tug was oversized compared to the size of the ship. And a small tug movement produced a negative effect onto the ship. The fast position change, correlated with the back flush of the propeller of the tug and the unfavorable breast line heading, led to the breaking of the mooring line.";;;"No";"UK";"Internal waters -> Port area";"UNITED KINGDOM";"United Kingdom";"England";53.641100;-0.202200;;"UNITED KINGDOM";"Immingham";"Night";"2 - Smooth - (0.1 - 0.5 m)";"Good - 5.0 <= Vis < 25.0 nm";"Clear";"4 - Moderate Breeze - knot (11-16) m/s (6-8)";;;;;"2024-08-08";"2025-02-19";"2022-01-01";"2024-12-31"

They were removing a tray from the steam oven using oven gloves. When removing the tray, hot water from the top of the tray spilled onto their left arm. The crew member took first aid actions, running their injured arm under cold water for 20 minutes however the burn was not getting better. They reported this to their supervisor and the captain of the vessel agreed that the crew member should be sent ashore to hospital. After receiving treatment at hospital the crew member was advised that they would need to return to hospital regularly to have the dressing changed. This meant that the crew member was not able to continue with the duties of their role on board and were disembarked for this reason. The incident occurred due to the fact that the crew member overlooked the fact that there would be hot water on top of the tray. The vessel carried out a review of safe working practices in the galley and provided further training to crew members on the safe use of galley equipment.

There was a light rain shower at the time and the temperature above 0’C, so no ice. As the vessel enters Stromness harbour, proceeding to the berth, the IP got out from the wheelhouse to get all the ropes ready for docking the boat overnight. After completing that activity, the IP went back to the wheelhouse to get their personal belongings. They’ve changed from work wellington boots to their own steel toe work footwear, (they’ve used that brand of footwear for past 4 years, and never had issues). However when they step out from wheelhouse again, to put side ropes to the ladder at the berth, the mooring rope they got ready earlier, appears to have moved a little into the area just outside wheelhouse door. When they step out they’ve put their right foot directly onto the mooring rope and their foot rolled over from the rope causing what they thought was an ankle strain. The foot was swollen and following a week off work they returned to their Dr, who in turn recommended an X-ray, where it was discovered that there was a fracture to the base ® metatarsal.

As the bow of the vessel became clear of the hoist, more power was engaged to the engines in astern, but the ebb flow of the tide had already taken the stern downstream and there was too much force on the beam to bring the stern upstream in time to avoid contacting the pier wall. Crew arranged fenders on the starboard side and then contact was made on starboard side on the pier wall. They tried to manoeuvre the vessel away from the wall but the force of the ebb tide was too great. A local tug boat was able to throw a line which they attached to port stern post cleat. The stern was then pulled up stream and they engaged the engines to astern to power away from the the pier. They were then able to moor the vessel on the jetty and assess the damage and check bilges for any leaks.
