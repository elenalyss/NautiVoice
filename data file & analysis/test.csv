A sail training vessel grounded during departure with a pilot on board. Reportedly the vessel was being navigated by the captain with the pilot's advice when a course alteration to port was necessary but too much rudder was applied and the vessel began to turn too quickly coming to rest on the sand at the edge of the deep water channel. The crew of the sail training vessel initially attempted to push the vessel off the sand with ship's own tender but it was unsuccessful so a tug was ordered from the port. The tug made fast on the stern of the sail training vessel and pulled the vessel free of the sandbank. The vessel then proceeded to sea without further incident. The incident reportedly occurred because the master failed to challenge the pilot's helm order as being too broad for the turn. ,Grounding / Stranding,Low

"The vessel was inbound to a port, and the Master was on on the wheel, in darkness and rain with westerly winds, 15 knots gusting 25 knots. The turn was made around and the course steadied on inbound leads, shortly after course was altered to port to bring the ship over for the turn into anticipating a drift due to westerly winds. A crew member reported at 15ft off the port and the rate of turn was slowed. The wind had shifted whilst transiting the river to the North West at 20 knots and was now on the starboard side of the vessel, and this had not been initially appreciated by the Master. The lookout reported the vessel was very close to the moored yachts and both fwd and aft voith units were set to thrust away from the yachts at 40%. This had the effect of moving the bow off but closing the stern towards the moorings, and the yacht was observed making alight-glancing contact with the vessel. The remainder of the passage continued without further incident. No damage was confirmed on the ro-pax ferry, nor any pollution however, there was minor damage to the shroud and hull scuff marks. No pollution. It is likely that the Master thought a squall had passed so he went down from four engines to two. Another squall appeared fairly rapidly whilst the vessel was in a river and the slight delay in getting more power on resulted in the the glancing contact. ",Collision,Low
